.. _global_schema:

Global Schema
==============

The global schema file (`global.schema.json <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildtesters/buildtest/devel/buildtest/schemas/global.schema.json>`_)
is validated with for all buildspecs and this schema defines the top-level structure of the buildspec file. In particular this will validate
the ``buildspecs`` keyword which is a JSON object that defines one or more tests (buildspecs). Each test must be unique name.


Schema Definition
------------------

Shown below is the start of the schema definition for  **global.schema.json**

.. literalinclude:: ../../buildtest/schemas/global.schema.json
   :lines: 1-8
   :language: json

This schema requires that every buildspec should have ``buildspecs`` which is the start of test declaration and
each test will contain a ``type`` field to look for appropriate sub-schema.

Example Buildspec
------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/hello_world.yml
   :language: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 1,2,4

The field  ``buildspecs`` and ``maintainers`` are validated with **global.schema.json**
using `jsonschema.validate <https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_modules/jsonschema/validators/#validate>`_
method. The test section within ``hello_world`` is validated by sub-schema by looking up schema based
on ``type`` field.

Every sub-schema requires **type** field in this case, ``type: script`` informs
buildtest to validate with the :ref:`script_schema` which will use schema `script.schema.json <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildtesters/buildtest/devel/buildtest/schemas/script.schema.json>`_

To learn more about how buildtest validates the buildspec, please see :ref:`parsing buildspecs <parse_buildspecs>`.

.. _maintainers:

Defining Maintainers
---------------------

The ``maintainers`` is an optional field that can be used to specify a list of test maintainers for a given buildspec.
The **maintainers** property is used by buildtest to report :ref:`buildspecs by maintainers <buildspec_maintainers>` when querying
buildspec cache. You can also :ref:`filter buildspecs <filter_buildspecs_with_buildtest_build>` by maintainers during
building via ``buildtest build --filter maintainers=<NAME>`` if one wants to filter tests


In this example, we have two maintainers ``@johndoe`` and ``@bobsmith``. The maintainers is a list of strings but must
be unique names, generally this can be your name or preferably a github or gitlab handle.

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/maintainers_example.yml
   :language: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 11-13

Test Names
-----------

The **buildspecs** property is a JSON object that defines one or more test. This
is defined in JSON as follows:

.. code-block:: json

       "buildspecs": {
         "type": "object",
         "description": "This section is used to define one or more tests (buildspecs). Each test must be unique name",
         "propertyNames": {
           "pattern": "^[A-Za-z_.-][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*$",
           "maxLength": 48
         }
       }

The test names are limited to 48 characters and follow the regular expression defined in **pattern** property. In previous example, the test name is **hello_world**.
You must have unique testname in your **buildspecs** section, otherwise you will have an invalid buildspec file.

.. Note:: We refer to the entire YAML content as **buildspec file**, this is not to be confused with the **buildspecs** field.

Buildspec Structure
--------------------

Shown below is an overview of buildspec file. In this diagram we define one test within
``buildspecs`` property named ``systemd_default_target``. This test is using the
script schema defined by ``type: script``. The ``executor`` property is a required
property that determines how test is run. The executors are defined in buildtest configuration
see :ref:`configuring_buildtest` for more details. The ``description`` field is used to
document the test and limited to 80 characters.

The ``run`` property is used for defining content of script, this can a shell-script
(bash,csh) or python script.
