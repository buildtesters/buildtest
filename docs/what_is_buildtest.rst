Background
------------

HPC System and Software Stack are tightly integrated with underlying architecture
which makes them highly sensitive to changes in system
such as OS, kernel, driver, or vendor updates. We need a testing
framework to automate acceptance testing of an HPC system so that HPC Support Teams
can increase **confidence** of their HPC system throughout the system lifecycle.

Motivation
-----------

There are many build automations tools for compiling source code into binary code,
the most used tool is the **make** utility found in most Linux systems. Build
scripts like **configure**, **cmake** and **autoconf** can generate files
used by make for installing the software. Makefile is a file used by make
program that shows how to compile and link a program which is the basis for
building a software package. One can invoke **make test** which will run the
target named **test** in Makefile that dictates how tests are compiled and run.
Makefile is hard to interpret and requires in-depth experience with
shell-scripting and strong understanding of how package is built and tested.
Note that package maintainers must provide the source files, headers, and
additional libraries to test the software and make test simply the test
compilation and execution. Tools like `configure`, `cmake` and `autoconf` are
insufficient for testing because HPC software stack consist of applications
packaged in many formats and some are make-incompatible.

We wanted a framework that hides the complexity for compiling source code and
provide an easy markup language to define test configuration to create the test.
This leads to buildtest, which is a testing framework that generates test-scripts
using YAML that is validated with JSON Schemas. YAML was picked given its ease-of-use
and it lowers the barrier for writing tests.

Inception of buildtest
---------------------------

buildtest was founded by `Shahzeb Siddiqui <https://github.com/shahzebsiddiqui>`_
in 2017 when he was at `Pfizer <https://www.pfizer.com/>`_ tasked for testing
software stack for a data center migration.

Shahzeb was tasked with testing the software ecosystem by focusing on the most
important application due to time constraints. During this period, several dozen
test scripts were developed in shell-script that targeted core HPC tools such as
compilers, **MPI**, **R**, **Python**, etc. A single master script was used to
run all the tests which led to `buildtest`.

Preview of buildtest
----------------------

You can run ``buildtest show`` followed by name of command and it will provide an overview of the buildtest.

.. dropdown:: ``buildtest show build``

    .. command-output:: buildtest show build

.. dropdown:: ``buildtest show buildspec``

    .. command-output:: buildtest show buildspec

.. dropdown:: ``buildtest show report``

    .. command-output:: buildtest show report

.. dropdown:: ``buildtest show inspect``

    .. command-output:: buildtest show inspect

.. dropdown:: ``buildtest show config``

    .. command-output:: buildtest show config

Target Audience & Use Case
---------------------------

buildtest target audience is `HPC Staff` that wants to perform acceptance &
regression testing of their HPC system.

buildtest is not

  - replacement for `make`, `cmake`, `autoconf`, `ctest`
  - a software build framework (`easybuild <https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/>`_, `spack <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, `nix <https://nixos.org/>`_ , `guix <https://guix.gnu.org/>`_)
  - a replacement for benchmark tools or test suite from upstream package
  - a replacement for writing tests, you will need to write your tests defined by buildtest schemas, however you can copy/paste & adapt tests from other sites that are applicable to you.

Typical use-case:

  - Run your test suite during system maintenance
  - Perform daily tests for testing various system components. These tests should be short
  - Run weekly/biweekly test on medium/large workload including micro-benchmark
  - Run tests for newly installed software package typically requested by user.
