.. Note:: This project is under development, the official release will be in 2020.

Welcome to `buildtest <https://github.com/HPC-buildtest/buildtest-framework>`_  is
a framework for automating tests creation  to conduct software stack testing for
HPC facilities. buildtest aims to abstract test complexity such that a user can
focus on writing test with minimal knowledge of the system. Test configuration
are reusable between HPC sites with the goal of sharing tests between the
HPC community.
